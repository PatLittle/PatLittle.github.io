I'm Pat Little - a data practitioner, public servant, and longtime member of the Open.Canada.ca team.

On this site, I plan to share a variety of data / opendata related posts, adjacent to my role as a public servant, but from my personal perspective.

While intended to be informative and professionally appropriate, this blog is not authored in an official capacity. The views expressed here are my own, and don’t represent the opinions of my team or my employer.
