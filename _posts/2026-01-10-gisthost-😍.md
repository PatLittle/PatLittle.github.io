# Gisthost 💯 Matches the Vibe

Are you someone who finds themselves vibe-coding little web projects or prototypes they want to share?

* Something you aren't really planning to developing into a full on project - not worthy of the place of honor 🏆 pinned at the top of your github profile.
* Is the last thing you need is another AWS free trial account, bound to bill you $1.23USD per month for the next 5 years?



**This is Me Pretty Often** 
> especially as Codex-5.2 et al. can accomplish longer running tasks without intervention, it's so effortless to have Agents churning away in the background spitting out little widgets, personal utility tools, data driven documentation, etc.   

I often find I have Codex building single HTML file, client side webapps, and `python -m http.server` is easypeasy. Even just opening the file directly in a browser works fine when its self-sufficenct, without a CORS blocker. 

But that's a single player game..
