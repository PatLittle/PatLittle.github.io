## "Gisthost 💯 Matches the Vibe" - me

### Intro
Are you someone who's always vibe-coding little webapps or prototypes?
  * ✅ Would be better to have it in source control?
  * ❌ But not something you want to pin to the top of your github profile with pride. 🫤
  * ✅ Want to have it saved to the cloud? 
  * ❌ Is the last thing you need another free cloud trial account, bound to bill you $1.23USD per month for the next 5 years?
  * ✅ Want to share and colaborate?
  * ❌ Don't want a bunch of complexity & overhead? 
    * 💡 **You know like a Gist... but can be rendered as a webpage**


🙋‍♂️**This sounds like me** 

#### I often use a 1-file-webapp - creating small client side webapps with the HTML,CSS, JS all in one html file.



  * When working locally, just serving the HTML with `python -m http.server` is easypeasy. 
  * Or just opening the HTML file directly in a browser works fine when its self-sufficenct, CORS error free 🤞
   
 *But that's a single player game..*

On January 1st, Simon Wilson announced on his blog that he was reviving a long dormant project `gistpreview.github.io`.

The project is released here [https://gisthost.github.io/ ](https://gisthost.github.io) and joins Simons' high profile portfolio of open source data tools, created with his distinct taste for user deployable tools, and comprehensible architectures and techniques.

## My Usecase

I was trying to demonstrate for a Web Team in another department, how they could build a dynamic webpage that leverages data they publish on [Open.Canada.ca](https://open.canada.ca/data) on their departmental website.<br>

I often see GC web teams manually managing the same content in multiple places, creating headaches for ongoing maintainance, and conflicting information on different pages.<br> 

Managing data & content once, and reusing it in relevant places across the enterprise web presence seems obvious to me, but currently I think that approach is being under used.
  - just from my observations, no observation of a representitive sample here.


Vibe coding up an example, instead of struggling to describe "the art of the possible" in an email, is like the 1000-word-picture on steriods 💪<br>  
This type of single use software development really starts to make sense in 2026 when you can have AI is doing 90% of the work, and your 10% is just describing what you want. 

With Codex running GPT 5.2, starting from a probably less than ideal prompt and context, I was able to get:

  <figcaption>
This page brings in GC Consultations Data from https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/7c03f039-3753-4093-af60-74b0f7b2385d using the CKAN API, then renders the JSON in cards. </figcaption>

<figcaption>The cards open to a Modal view that shows all the record level data. And I added an `.ics` calendar export so you can add the consultations to your calendar. </figcaption>

<figcaption>At the top the users can configure exactly what data they want to filter, refining the GC Wide dataset to the specific records an area within a department might want to feature on a program's page for example.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Then at the bottom they can export the code used on the page, giving them a starting point to implement their own page, with the relevant filters on the data applied. </figcaption>

<figcaption>I even take a stab at getting the language toggle working, and since the source data has all free text in `EN` and `FR` the hard part of handling OL is already done.</figcaption>

#### But I didn't have a great way to share

  * Especially for a colleage more on the business side, than a web developer
  * And I wasn't looking to setup something like a GitHub page, more appropriate for ongoing use, not a one time use situation.

  Using the [GistHost](https://gisthost.github.io) tool from Simon, I was able to just push my single HTML file to a Gist on GitHub.<br>
  Then at `GistHost.io` input the Gist ID to get the link to it as a working prototype.

### More on Simon

A bit of a celeb in the Open Source / Data circles, in [2025 he was the top ranked blogger contrbuting to hacker news](https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2025-01-01&end=2025-12-31&domain=simonwillison.net). Simon also co-founded Django, the widely used python framework. He has also been recognized by the [GitHub Stars](http://stars.github.com) program for his tremendous impact educating, inspiring and building communities around open source projects. 

He is also the creator of https://datasette.io/ an ecosystem of tools desinged for data journalism. He is actively releasing new plugins and features, along with content and tutorials you don't need to be a 10x engineer to follow and adapt for your projects. 

> The first time I came across one of Simon's tutorials I picked up the single most useful technique I keep at the top of my data playbook 📖.
> GitScraping is a ultra powerful tool for tracking data, change data capture, and basic automation.
> Since I first picked up the technique from Simon around 6 or 7 years ago, not a single day has gone by where I haven't had some type of metrics or external data being fetched, compared for changes, and stored for safekeeping automatically on my behalf.
> > If you don't yet have this tool 🪛 in your toolbox 🧰, this is could be best return on a 5 minute time investment you get for 2026.
