> **“Gisthost 💯 matches the vibe.”** — me

### Intro

Do you like to vibe-code little webapps and prototypes?

- ✅ You want source control
- ❌ But not ready to proudly pin it to the top your GitHub profile
- ✅ You want to share and collaborate
- ❌ Without a pile of tooling and overhead

💡 *You want a Gist… but have rendered as a webpage?*

🙋‍♂️ **Yep, that’s me.**

## The 1-file webapp

I often build **single-file webapps** for vibe coding: HTML, CSS, and JS all in one file, low complexity.

- Locally: `python -m http.server` → done
- Or just open the file directly if it’s self-contained and CORS-friendly 🤞

But… that’s a single-player game.

## Simon Willison built exactly what I needed 🙌

On January 1st, Simon Willison announced the revival of a long-dormant project: **gistpreview**, now reborn as\

Classic Simon: simple, deployable, understandable. A tiny tool with massive leverage.

## My use case

I was trying to show another GC web team how **Open.Canada.ca data can power dynamic pages elsewhere**, instead of manually duplicating content across sites.

I see this *all the time*:

- Same content, multiple places, hand coded in html tables,
- Not technically duplicate content... since none of the versions match.

So instead of spending time writing a long email about “the art of the possible,” vibe-coding working examples is a much more satisfying use of time . A prototype has gotta be worth **at least twice as much as the 1,000 word picture** — especially with 2026 tools

With Codex + GPT-5.2, this came together in **2–3 iterations** from a rough prompt.

## The sharing problem (solved)

I needed something that:

- *Just worked*
- Would work on locked-down Gov Laptops
- Had zero “works on my machine” issues
- Was fine for a one-off prototype

**Gisthost nailed it.**

I pushed the HTML to a GitHub Gist, dropped the ID into Gisthost, and instantly had a live, shareable prototype.

**Gisthost might be the vibe🔝🆙 your vibe coding needs.**

## A quick nod to Simon

Simon Willison is a legend in open source and data circles:

- Django co-founder
- Top-ranked Hacker News blogger in 2025
- GitHub Star
- Creator of **Datasette**

One of the most valuable techniques I ever learned came from him:

### GitScraping

A ridiculously powerful pattern for:

- Tracking external data
- Detecting change
- Auto-archiving results in Git

I’ve been using it for **6–7 years**, and I still use it *constantly*.

If it’s not in your toolbox yet, it might be the **best 5-minute investment you make in 2026**.

### HTML tools / 1-file webapps

Turns out Simon’s been thinking about this too. He calls them **HTML tools**:

> “HTML applications that combine HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in a single file to provide useful functionality.”

He’s published **150+** of them at\
