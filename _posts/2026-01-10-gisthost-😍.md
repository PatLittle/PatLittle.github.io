# Gisthost 💯 Matches the Vibe

## Intro
Are you someone who finds themselves vibe-coding little web projects or prototypes they want to share, or save, or have in source control?
  * Not something you plan to develop into a full on project
  * Not something you really want to pin to the top of your github profile with pride. 🫤
  * Is the last thing you need another free cloud trial account, bound to bill you $1.23USD per month for the next 5 years?
    * 💡 **You know - like a Gist but a webpage**


**This is Me Pretty Often** 

 *  As Codex now on GPT5.2,  etc., can accomplish longer running tasks without intervention, it's so effortless to have Agents churning away in the background spitting out little widgets, personal utility tools, data driven documentation, etc.   

I often find many of my vibe coding builds end up in the form of 1 HTML file, client side webapps.\
Locally, just serving the HTML with `python -m http.server` is easypeasy.

Or just opening the HTML file directly in a browser works fine when its self-sufficenct, CORS error free 🤞.\
But that's a single player game..
