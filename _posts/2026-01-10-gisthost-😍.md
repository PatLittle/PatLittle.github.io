## Gisthost 💯 Matches the Vibe

### Intro
Are you someone who's always vibe-coding little webapps or prototypes?
  * ✅ Would be better to have it in source control?
  * ❌ But not something you want to pin to the top of your github profile with pride. 🫤
  * ✅ Want to have it saved to the cloud? 
  * ❌ Is the last thing you need another free cloud trial account, bound to bill you $1.23USD per month for the next 5 years?
  * ✅ Want to share and colaborate?
  * ❌ Don't want a bunch of complexity & overhead? 
    * 💡 **You know like a Gist... but can be rendered as a webpage**


🙋‍♂️**This sounds like me** 

#### I often use a 1-file-webapp architechture, creating small client side webapps with the HTML,CSS, JS all in one html file.



 * Locally, just serving the HTML with `python -m http.s erver` is easypeasy. 
 * Or just opening the HTML file directly in a browser works fine when its self-sufficenct, CORS error free 🤞
   
 *But that's a single player game..*

On January 1st, Simon Wilson announced on his blog that he was reviving a long dormant project `gistpreview.github.io`.

The project is released here [https://gisthost.github.io/ ](https://gisthost.github.io) and joins Simons' high profile portfolio of open source data tools, created with his distinct taste for user deployable tools, and comprehensible architectures and techniques.

### More on Simon

A bit of a celeb in the Open Source / Data circles, in [2025 he was the top ranked blogger contrbuting to hacker news](https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2025-01-01&end=2025-12-31&domain=simonwillison.net). Simon also co-founded Django, the widely used python framework. He has also been recognized by the [GitHub Stars](http://stars.github.com) program for his tremendous impact educating, inspiring and building communities around open source projects. 

He is also the creator of https://datasette.io/ an ecosystem of tools desinged for data journalism. He is actively releasing new plugins and features, along with content and tutorials you don't need to be a 10x engineer to follow and adapt for your projects. 

> The first time I came across one of Simon's tutorials I picked up the single most useful technique I keep at the top of my data playbook 📖.
> GitScraping is a ultra powerful tool for tracking data, change data capture, and basic automation.
> Since I first picked up the technique from Simon around 6 or 7 years ago, not a single day has gone by where I haven't had some type of metrics or external data being fetched, compared for changes, and stored for safekeeping automatically on my behalf.
> > If you don't yet have this tool 🪛 in your toolbox 🧰, this is could be best return on a 5 minute time investment you get for 2026.
