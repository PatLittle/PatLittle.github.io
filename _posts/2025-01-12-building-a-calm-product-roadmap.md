A calm roadmap is one that balances ambition with focus. Start by articulating the outcomes you want to enable, then align each initiative to a measurable outcome.

## Three ways to keep it calm

1. **Limit work in progress.** Choose fewer big bets so the team can win.
2. **Share the why.** Every roadmap item should explain the customer impact.
3. **Review monthly.** Make small course corrections before they become pivots.
