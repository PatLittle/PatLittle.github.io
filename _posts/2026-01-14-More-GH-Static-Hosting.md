In my last post I talked about the [https://Gisthost.github.io](https://gisthost.github.io/) tool that Simon Willison revived by forking a version from a project that was no longer being maintained.

## Update

Since posting that a few days ago, I noticed Simon created another project in GitHub [orphanhost.github.io](https://github.com/orphanhost/orphanhost.github.io).


This tool allows you to serve a HTML page from a file in a Github Repo, on any branch, without using a static site generator such as Jekyll, Hugo, etc.

## Example

For example [a11y-rpt-test-output/test.html](https://orphanhost.github.io/?PatLittle/test/main/a11y-rpt-test-output/test.html) is an HTML file I have in a repo, but not being rendered as a static page anywhere.
Just adding the repository and file info is all you need to do to have it as an interactive page.

This is a variation on GistHost.github.io that adds another option for you and your projects.
